End-to-End Multi-Class Dog Breed Classification
This model builds a end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

1. Problem
Identyfing the breed of a dog given the image of a dog.

2. Data
The data we are using from Kaggle Dog Breed Identification:-

https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

3. Evaluation
The Evaluation is for each image in the test set, we must predict a probability for each of the different breeds.

4. Features
Some information about data:

We are dealing with images(Unstructured data)
There are 120 breeds of dog(This means that there are 120 classes)
There are around 10,000 images in training set(These images have labels)
There are around 10,000 imates in test set (These images have no labels)
